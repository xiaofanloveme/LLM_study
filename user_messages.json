{"role": "user", "content": "提示：请帮我总结这段文字。超声换能器（Ultrasonic transducer）是在超声波频率范围内，实现声能和电能相互转换的换能器，主要分为三类：发射器、接收器和收发两用型换能器。用来发射超声波的换能器称为发射器，当换能器处于发射状态时，将电能转换为机械能，再转换为声能；用来接收声波的换能器称为接收器，当换能器处于接收状态时，将声能转换为机械能，再转换为电能；在有些情况下，换能器既可用作发射器，又可用作接收器，称为收发两用型换能器。它是超声技术的核心内容和关键技术之一，广泛应用于无损检测、医学影像、超声显微镜、指纹识别及物联网等领域。与雷达、声纳类似，超声换能器多用于利用回波信号评估目标物体的系统，通过测量超声信号收发的时间间隔，可以确定目标物体与换能器间的距离。被动式超声传感器实际上就是检测超声波信号的麦克风。按照实现超声换能器机电转换的物理效应的不同，可将换能器分为电动式、电磁式、磁致伸缩式、压电式和电致伸缩式等[1]:2-3。目前理论研究和实际应用最为广泛的是压电超声换能器。通常发射换能器工作频率等于其本身的谐振基频以获得最佳工作状态。被动式接收换能器的工作频率为一较宽频带，同时要求换能器自身的谐振基频比频带的最高频率高，以保证换能器有平坦的接收响应。从维度上来讲，换能器通常包含单个或多个阵元，从而有单阵元探头、线阵探头、面阵探头和环阵探头等。单阵元超声换能器相对容易制造，但必须通过高线性精度的机械驱动以获得超声图像，这限制了它的刷新频率和成像质量。超声换能器阵可以通过电子控制，从而快速获得多维度的信息，结合相控阵技术，可以控制超声波束的偏转和聚焦，进一步提高分辨率、灵敏度和输出功率。未经极化的压电陶瓷中的电轴取向杂乱，不具压电效应。经过极化工序处理后才能显示压电效应。极化过程就是在压电陶瓷上加一个强直流电场，使陶瓷中的电轴沿电场方向取向排列。"},
